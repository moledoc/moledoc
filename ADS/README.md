# Algorithms and Data Structures

This documentation is **mostly** (but information is taken from other places as well) based on 'Introduction to Algorithms Second Edition' by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein.
The code is written by me, using (mainly) pseudocode from the mentioned source.
