Hi, my name is Meelis Utt aka `moledoc`.

How the handle came to be:

* Meelis Utt -> M.Utt -> mutt -> mole (like an animal) in Estonian <img align="middle" alt="mole" width="40px" src="https://github.com/moledoc/moledoc/blob/main/images/krtek12.jpg" />
* I named my linux repositories with prefix mole (eg molecurrent). Since I had this naming convention, I aliased my linux build documentation as `moledoc`. It was short and punny name, so I decided to use it as my handle.

Since I used `moledoc` keyword with my documentations, then initially this repository was for documentations.
Specifically, this repository was and still is a collection of run-down documentations I've written to have a place to look up more concise/relevant documentation to me.
However, since this readme is shown on my github profile, then I've added a bit about myself to this readme.

## What are my next projects

* revive [goava](https://github.com/moledoc/goava.git) and make it into a proper project
* revive [ytf](https://github.com/moledoc/ytf.git)
* do some cleanup in the projects I transfered from my other experimenting account
* explore lower level networking - starting with C, but also in Go
