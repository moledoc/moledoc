Hi, my name is Meelis Utt aka `moledoc`.

How the handle came to be:

* Meelis Utt -> M.Utt -> mutt -> mole (like an animal) in Estonian <img align="middle" alt="mole" width="40px" src="https://github.com/moledoc/moledoc/blob/main/images/krtek12.jpg" />
* I named my linux repositories with prefix mole (eg molecurrent). Since I had this naming convention, I aliased my linux build documentation as `moledoc`. It was short and punny name, so I decided to use it as my handle.

Since I used `moledoc` keyword with my documentations, then initially this repository was for documentations.
Specifically, this repository was and still is a collection of run-down documentations I've written to have a place to look up more concise/relevant documentation to me.
However, since this readme is shown on my github profile, then I've added a bit about myself to this readme.

## What are my next projects

* go through past advent of code problems and have fun (different languages/approaches/etc, would be fine to solve same problem multiple times) - [repo for that](https://github.com/moledoc/aoc.git)
* explore usage of cloudflare/gokey or implement simple vaultless password manager myself
* evolve [headers](https://github.com/moledoc/headers.git) repo, e.g. my own string header/implementation, dynamic arrays, atoi/atof/etc
* revive [ytf](https://github.com/moledoc/ytf.git)
* explore lower level networking and sockets - starting with C, but also in Go
