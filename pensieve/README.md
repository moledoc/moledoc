## Extracted

* To move away from your reference point (current self), small steps are necessary to move the reference point to the desired direction. Bigger steps are met with resistance: loss aversion keeps us near our reference point. - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, paraphrasing 304-305
	* *DERIVED*: Small steps make big reps.
		* *EXPAND*: continuously making small steps will create a habit that will in the long run make a big difference/change. This applies to both positive and negative directions.
* Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it. - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p 402
* Humans are sequencial, they can't multitask. For that reason, try to focus on one thing at a time (eg until small milestone).
	* Metaphor for sequentiality that ties into the phrase 'train of thought': each thought/action is a train and you are the passenger. Switching between trains are costly: you need to exit the current train, walk to correct platform and possibly wait for the train. Ie switching from one though/action you need to exit the current one, go into the correct mindspace and be there for some time to be able to board that thought. Doing this switch often makes you unproductive: you thoughts can't travel great distances, if it's constantly switching contexts.
* Rule of writing: If you want to clarify your thinking, remember something important or communicate something clearly - *WRITE IT DOWN*.
* *FOOD FOR THOUGHT*: Garbage collect your brain/transfer the responsibility of remembering: everything that can be written down. Do it when remembering tasks/events/todos/shopping lists/events etc.  This clears/de-allocates your brains resources, which allow to allocate them to more relevant task.
	* essentially pensieve
* First time throw away: first version is to understand the problem (ie if the code is bad, but it works, then it's fine), the next version(s) is(are) solving the problem (ie making the solution/code better).
* Code for product or learning, otherwise find existing solution.
* Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
	* from google: 'The phrase "slow is smooth, smooth is fast" originates from the SEAL teams but the purpose behind it can be applied to all situations. There are many situations when we want to react quickly and start moving, but in your efforts to move so quickly, you end up slowing down the operation'. 
	* *EXPAND*: sometimes slowing down makes you see the problem more clearly and make less mistakes.
* Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p46
	* *BUILD UPON*: Knowing more information from memory (without looking up) allows for more and faster deployment of attention, ie being more productive/intelligent.
	* *BUILD UPON*: Above is the reason why you should be memorizing in learning and not giving the excuse of 'I can look it up'.
* The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition. - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p237
	* *TAKE AWAY*: Experience in everything is essentially pattern matching.
* Whether professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback, as well as on sufficient opportunity to practice. - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p 241
* When giving estimates, include the unknown unknowns. Use the outside view: how have similar projects done (time, success etc). - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, paraphrasing
* Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones: Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p 302 
	* *ESSENCE*: bad is stronger than good
* Consistent overweighting of improbable outcomes eventually leads to inferior outcomes - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p 321
* You will do yourself a large (financial) favor if you are able to see each of (life) gambles as part of a bundle of small gambles and rehearse the mantra: you win a few, you lose a few. - Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p 338 paraphrasing
	* *TAKE AWAY*: you win a few, you lose a few
* You are less prone to useless churning of your portfolio if you don't know how every stock in it is doing every day/week/month. A commitment not to change one's position for several periods improve financial performance -  Thinking, fast and slow; Daniel Kahneman, p 340
* (For me) Being prepared is one ingredient to success.
	* Being prepared for different situations makes me more calm and confident.
	* I've noticed that certain types of uncertainty/lack of knowledge makes me anxious/nervous.
* Value of good night's sleep is the productivity and performance of the next day.
* Sane defaults make great effort.
	* *EXPAND*: Sane defaults make life easier, more convenient, consistent and more care free. For that reason a person should set good set of defaults to oneself and stick with them.
* For me, annoying myself makes me more productive:
	* *EXAMPLE*: notifications to stand during work day.
	* *EXAMPLE*: put things I need to deal with to a place, that will annoy me.
* If it takes less than 15 min the do it now, don't postpone it.
	* *NOTE*: could replace 15 with 10 or 5 as well.
	* *EXPAND*: doing the things now will make you more productive and give small victories for the day.
	* *EXPAND*: the small tasks won't then pile up and become big undertaking, that might be even harder to do.
* Smart devices/solutions are good for everyday live (by making things easier/more comfortable/etc), but analog is superior in edge cases/irregular situations.
	* *EXPAND*: smart device/solution failing in critical situation could be really painful; analog is usually more robust, albeit less featureful.
* *FOOD FOR THOUGHT*: Second is an eternity. You decide what you do with that.
* Information is currency with high value - 21 Ãµppetundi 21.sajandiks, p23 paraphrasing
* Information has significantly less value without a context.
* Give a better presentation:
	* illustrative gestures
	* deliberate movement
	* solid eye contact (1-1.5 sentences)
	* not looking at visual aid
	* pause after key ideas
* SITREP to give status update (situation report): 
	1. situation to date (what has happened)
	2. action to date (what has been done)
	3. actions to be completed (what will be done)
	4. issues/achievements/other
